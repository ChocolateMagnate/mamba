  File:        graphemes.hh

  Summary:     Contains Unicode-aware routines related to identification of single graphemes, those being
               individual human writing system units. There are multiple character encodings supported in Mamba,
               such as ASCII, UTF-8, UTF-16 and UTF-32, and the functions that extract their Unicode code points
               and size in bytes can be found here.

  Notes:       Unicode is a common standard used to convey characters from all writing systems in the world within
               a single framework. It was created to address the challenges in the variability in character encodings
               used for non-ASCII languages, such as ISO 8859, Shift JIS or KOI8-U. Under the hood, everything Unicode
               does is mapping between all units of writing systems such as letters, numbers, special characters and
               emojis to a unique number representation, called code point, commonly denoted with U+. For example,
               the English letter E is U+0045, the Slavic letter ะ is U+0416 and the French letter cedilla รง is U+00E7.
               These individual characters that are units of human writing systems are called graphemes or glyphs.
               All graphemes below U+10FFFF inclusively are called Basic Multilingual Plane (BML), where all graphemes
               belong to alphabets of natural languages: Latin alphabet, Cyrillic, Arabic script, Japanese kanji,
               number digits and some special characters like underscores or the dollar sign. Unicode also includes
               graphemes beyond language alphabets, such as exponents and emojis. Since Unicode is enormous, there are
               different character encodings that actualise it into specific schemes how numbers are converted into
               a sequence of bytes and interpreted. Hence, multiple Unicode Transport Formats (UTF) encodings emerged
               that each takes from 8 (UTF-8), 16 (UTF-16) and 32 (UTF-32) bits to represent various graphemes.
               Generally speaking, UTF-8 is the mostly widely used encoding almost exclusively used on the Internet,
               Unix systems, and has recently gained wider support on Windows. UTF-8 is completely backward-compatible
               with ASCII, is space efficient, and has universal support in terminal emulators, meaning one can print
               UTF-8-encoded strings out of the box. Despite these advantages, UTF-8 becomes space inefficient when
               dealing with a mix of different writing systems, where UTF-16 can be used as a good point of balance,
               although the space gains of UTF-16 over UTF-8 are often overestimated. UTF-32 is almost never used in
               practice. However, it has a peculiar advantage that it provides random-access of graphemes where they
               could be read directly from the index, while other encodings are variable-length and require
               sophisticated caching techniques to accelerate their access. This is why it may be used as an internal
               representation of strings and may be beneficial for certain optimisations that would benefit from it.
